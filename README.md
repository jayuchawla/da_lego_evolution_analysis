#### Analysing Evolution for Lego

## Problem Statement
#### You are a Data Analyst at Lego working with the Sales/Customer Success teams. The Accout Executive responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting with the Star Wars team. Although Star Wars _was_ critical to the survival of the brand, Lego has since introduced a wide variety of licensed sets over subsequent years.
-   ##### What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed ?
-   ##### In which year was Star Wars _not_ the most popular licensed theme (in terms of number of sets released that year) ?
